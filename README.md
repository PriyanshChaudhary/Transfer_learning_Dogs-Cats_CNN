# Transfer_learning_Dogs-Cats_CNN
This program makes use of Transfer Learning on a pre-trained model over a huge dataset while just adjusting the last classifier layer &amp; achieving higher accuracies on both test &amp; validation dataset(>95%).

# What is Transfer Learning?
Tranfer Learning is, when instead of training a model from scratch, you instead take a pre-trained model and adjust the weights and tweak the classes to make a new model that gives a better result on an unseen dataset.
  The fact is that if you use a model that has been designed to classify dogs, cats, plants & other wildlife to classify the gender of a human face, this will provide a better output than a newly trained model having dataset comprising of human faces. The main reason is that the previous model has more dat to train itself and hence is more developed than the newly trained mode with a relatively less number of dataset.
