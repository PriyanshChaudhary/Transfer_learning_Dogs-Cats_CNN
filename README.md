# Transfer_learning_Dogs-Cats_CNN
This program makes use of Transfer Learning on a pre-trained model over a huge dataset while just adjusting the last classifier layer &amp; achieving higher accuracies on both test &amp; validation dataset(>95%).

# What is Tranfer Learning?
Tranfer Learning is, when instead of training a model from scratch, you instead take a pre-trained model and adjust the weights and tweak the classes to make a new model that gives a better result on an unseen dataset.
